</p></font></h1> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>Dogs will love their own private room with a long private patio for stretching their legs.</p> <p>All rooms are comfortably air-conditioned and heated.</p>
<p>We offer personalized room service and housekeeping through out the day.
Our kennels are bright, roomy, and spotlessly clean.</p> <p>All boarding stays include FREE daily playcare where they can romp and run and relax the night away.</p>
<p>Additionally,
 each and every guest receives a minimum of 2 exercise sessions per day.</p> <p> The dogs are rotated out individually, or in groups based upon size and temperament.

 <br> We realize that all dogs are not friendly,
  and some even prefer to stay to themselves. We are committed to your pets well being and comfort while in our care!</p>
<p>  We offer separate secure fenced areas for small dogs, large dogs,

   and those who would just prefer to run and sniff privately. </p>
  <p>happy paws provides love, exercise and human/canine companionship in a safe and fun environment!</p>
